## Project overview
This is a simple self-introduction HTML page where I share a little about *myself*. Some of the elements can be reused as a template to build your own project.

## Sections
The page has *4 main* sections:
1. Introduction
2. Personal interests
3. My CV
4. Top 3 korean series

## Installation
This is a basic static project, so you can either **clone** the repository or **download** the zip file:
```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Shania-S/Shania-S.github.io.git

``` 

## Upcoming improvements
Currently, the page is only available in French. I plan on adding more languages soon ☺️!
The list of languages so far:
- [x] Français
- [ ] English
- [ ] Español
- [ ] 한국어
